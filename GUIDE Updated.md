## Installation Steps:

Step 1: Preparation: 

Disable your internet connection to prevent the software from performing online checks during installation.
Temporarily disable your antivirus software to avoid potential conflicts with the installation files. Be cautious and ensure you re-enable your antivirus immediately after completing the installation.

Step 2: Extracting Files:

Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a convenient location.

Navigate to the extracted folder and proceed to the 'Normal' subfolder to find another ZIP file. Extract this file in the same directory.

Step 3: Moving Folders:

Locate three folders within the extracted contents: two containing program files and one labeled 'Server'. Additionally, find two registry entries and a text file.

Move the extracted folder from Step 2 to the main installation directory chosen earlier. If prompted with a file conflict, choose to replace the existing files.

Step 4: Registry Entries:

Right-click on networks_serial_licensing and select 'Merge'. Allow any prompts that appear. Confirm successful merging; if not, seek further assistance.

Step 5: Server Installation:

Copy the Flexnet_Server folder and paste it into C:\Program Files.

Run server_install.bat as an administrator. If this option is unavailable, open Command Prompt as an administrator, navigate to the directory using cd, and execute the batch file using .\\server_install.bat.

Step 6: Completing the Installation:

Return to the original extraction location and extract the ISO/DVD file into the same directory.

Locate the setup executable within the newly extracted folder and run it as an administrator.

Follow the installation wizard, accepting terms and conditions without altering serial numbers. Proceed through warnings and continue with the installation.

Step 7: Post-Installation:

After installation, decline participation in the improvement program and opt to restart your computer later.
